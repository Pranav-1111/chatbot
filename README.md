# 🤖 AI Chatbot

This project solves the problem of handling repetitive support queries using NLP. It classifies user intent from chat using BERT and provides relevant responses via a Flask API. Useful for support automation in e-commerce and SaaS products.


# 🤖 AI Chatbot using BERT for Intent Classification

This project is an AI-powered chatbot built using **BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers)** to classify user queries into predefined intents and respond accordingly. It uses a **Flask backend**, a simple **HTML+JS frontend**, and is trained with HuggingFace's `transformers` library.
